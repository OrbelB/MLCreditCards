Data cleaning:
	while data cleaning first method of getting a cassifier was to 
	go through the credit card records and put approved for anyone 
	who had a credit card record

	with this method only ~8.5% aplicatswere accepted 

	The new method that I saw other doing was only accepting those who dont have
	alot of debt or are payed up 

	eith this method only ~1% where accetable 

Both methods created an oversampling issue
