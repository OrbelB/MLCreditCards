COMP 542 Group Project

Data cleaning:
	while data cleaning first method of getting a cassifier was to 
	go through the credit card records and put approved for anyone 
	who had a credit card record

	with this method only ~8.5% aplicatswere accepted 

	The new method that I saw other doing was only accepting those who dont have
	alot of debt or are payed up 

	eith this method only ~1% where accetable 

Both methods created an oversampling issue



GOING WITH METHOD 2
	however will include 0: 1-29 days past due 
		this is how other did it as well

	WILL BE LEAVING IN OUTLIERS	
	WILL NOT USER SMOTE ON TEST DATA, 
		TEST DATA NEED TO BE AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL DATA AS POSSIBLE

	IMPORTANT - CANT FIGURE OUT WHY
	While mergining the data, the guid we were following had ~9500 entries after mergin his files; however, after mergin our files we have ~36,000

TO ADD LATER
#Transforming all objects into numerical data
#will apply a classification to diffrent value types
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
for x in df_app:
    if df_app[x].dtypes=='object':
        df_app[x] = le.fit_transform(df_app[x])
